# Electrical Engineering Learning Portfolio

## About Me
I am a first-semester Electrical Engineering undergraduate.
This repository documents my learning process, experiments, and reflections
while studying C programming, circuit theory, and electrical simulations.

## Purpose
Here, I will not just store code, but demonstrate conceptual understanding, curiosity, and the ability to connect theory implementation.

## Tools Used
- C Programming
- LTspice
- Mathematical Modeling
